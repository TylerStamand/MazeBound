  Sentences:
  - "Hello, you're a person? \rAre you okay?"
  - "I've been here for years! You listen to me, you'll live long. \r\n"
  - This room seems to be a safe area, free of the monsters on the outside. I have
    been hiding here since I found it. This thing next to me seems to be a way out,
    but it looks like it's missing something.
  - I think the pieces are somewhere in the mazes outside of this room. If you could
    find the pieces, we might be able to make it out.
  - I have a sword I found in the mazes, it's not very good but it'll get you started.
    Lets run through the basics.
  - 'To attack, ''aim'' your mouse and ''click''

'
  - "To move, use 'WASD'\r"
  - "To open your inventory press 'I'.\r Here you'll find your sword. Press 'ESC'
    to close any menu you might find yourself in.\n"
  - Press F to interact if you find anyone else in the maze or see any chests and
    other suspicious objects.
  - Alright, you seem ready to head into the maze. There is an entrance at the back
    of this room. See what you can find! If you forget any of the things I told you,
    press 'ESC' to open your pause menu to see the instructions on the left.
