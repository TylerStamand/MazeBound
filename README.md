## Game Concept

Dungeon crawler:
</br>
</br>
You start in an unknown location (hub world) and your goal is to venture out into the dungeons to grow your base and progress the story to find answers and eventually escape. 

## Game Description

Our game concept takes its main inspiration from the Maze Runner movies/books and combines aspects of town managing and dungeon crawler games into one. The player starts inside the main hub that serves as the town and main safe haven without knowing why they are there. Without much information it becomes obvious they are surrounded by dangerous dungeons. To survive, the player must take risks to venture out, obtain, and make do with what it has to offer.

## Core Game Mechanics

* Fighting enemies
* Talking to NPCs
* Exploring
* Upgrading

## Story
Our player finds themselves in an unknown environment that is seemingly safe. The only other person here is the tutorial guide. He shows us around and accompanies us into the dungeon for the first time. On this mission, he dies and the player is left alone to their devices to figure out what to do for themselves. Later down the road, the tutorial guy is hinted at being “the big bad” and the player must discover whether he is as evil as it seems.
