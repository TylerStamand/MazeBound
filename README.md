## Game Description
______________________________________________________________________________


	
	Our game concept takes its main inspiration from the Maze Runner movies/books and combines aspects of 
 	town managing and dungeon crawler games into one. 
 
 	The player starts inside the main hub that serves as the town and main safe haven without knowing why they are there. 
 
  	Outside the hub are endless sprawling mazes 
  	
   	The only other person here is the tutorial guide. He gives guidence to the player when they start and progress the game. 
  
	The player will go on to find NPCs, loot items and find puzzle pieces in various 
    maze levels to progress the game.

_____________________________________________________________________________

## Getting started
______________________________________________________________________________

	- When starting a new game, you will begin in the hub with an old rusty 
	  spear equipped.
    
	- To enter a maze, simply walk into one of the maze entrances in the hub

	- Explore the mazes to find chests and NPCs in your quest to escape
	  the maze!

	- Use the scrap slot in the inventory to dismantle weapons to gain 
	  scrap. Scrap can be used by the Blacksmith to upgrade your weapons.

    

    Goal: 

	- Your goal is to obtain three pieces of the puzzle

	- One piece can be found in each maze

	- A piece is retrieved after interacting with three shrines within
	  a maze

	- Retrieving a piece in one maze will unlock the entrance to the 
	  next maze
